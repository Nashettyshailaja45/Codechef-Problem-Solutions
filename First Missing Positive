We can solve this problem in various ways.
1. By using Two Pointers.
2.By Using Minheap Concept.
3.By using Sorting method.


Below I used the minheap concept to solve this problem.

import heapq
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        heap=[]
        for n in nums:
            if(n>0):
                heapq.heappush(heap,n)
        mp=1
        while heap:
            s=heapq.heappop(heap)
            if(s==mp):
                mp+=1
